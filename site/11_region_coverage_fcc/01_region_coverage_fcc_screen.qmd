# STARR-seq and Tiling MPRA

fragment counts across accessible regions

regions with extreme low fragments were filtered using EdgeR

the log2 fold change of each regions were calculated using DEseq2

# Lenti-MPRA

The log2 fold change were first standardized to z scores using the negative controls (random shuffled seqeunces)

# CRISPRi-HCR FlowFISH

The log2 fold change of guides were standardized to z scores for each target respectively. 

After standardization, the safe-targeting guides were filtered. 

The mean of z scores were calculated for each target across accessible regions.

# CRISPRi-Growth screen

The log2 fold change of guides were standardized to z scores

The mean of z scores were calculated for each target across accessible regions.

Table: ratio = divided by total ATAC
Set ATAC as 100%; how many percentage of regions are screened by each assay?

|ASTARR         |100%           |100%         |
|WSTARR         |98%            |98%          |
|CRISPRi-Growth |48%            |33%          |
