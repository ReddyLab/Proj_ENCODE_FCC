# Loop calls

HICCUP method (reference)

```
observed	Raw contact count supporting that bin-pair (i.e. the number of Hi-C read pairs falling in these two bins)
expectedBL	Expected contact count under the “baseline” model (distance-dependent background)
expectedDonut	Expected count in the “donut” neighborhood (the local average of the 8 bins surrounding the pair)
expectedH	Expected count in the “horizontal” region (same row, flanking columns)
expectedV	Expected count in the “vertical” region (same column, flanking rows)
```

The observsed over expectation score for each loop was calculated from the counts summarized in the loop file.

$Log2OE = \frac{\text{Observed raw contact count}}{\text{Expected count in the surrounded bins}}$
