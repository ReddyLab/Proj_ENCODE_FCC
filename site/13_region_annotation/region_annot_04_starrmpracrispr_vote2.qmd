here we do not consider the assay direction

- direciton of CRISPR for each location could undergo different mechanism to affect gene expression
- the downstream analysis, we are using unsupervised methods

After assay vote 2:

|Region         |Count  |
|:--------------|:------|
|ATAC (Overlap) |33,953 |
|ATAC (Union)   |39,788 |

Below the report will focus on the ATAC (Overlap) (Number of regions = 33,953)

Count of those regions by assays

|Group          |ATAC (Overlap) |ATAC (Union) |
|:--------------|:--------------|:------------|
|ASTARR         |32,021         |37,777       |
|CRISPRi-Growth |3,713          |4,175        |
|CRISPRi-HCRFF  |49             |51           |
|E2G-Benchmark  |330            |338          |
|LMPRA          |18,043         |19,091       |
|TMPRA          |655            |796          |
|WSTARR         |25,331         |30,357       |


Count of those regions by assay types

|Type   |ATAC (Overlap) |ATAC (Union) |
|:------|:--------------|:------------|
|CRISPR |4,036          |4,507        |
|MPRA   |18,495         |19,650       |
|STARR  |33,796         |39,623       |
