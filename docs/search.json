In this part, we integrated the STARR/MPRA/CRISPRi/Hi-C assays with genomic annotations of chromatin states (cCREs/ChromHMM) and TF binding sites in order to:\n\nQualitative analyze the regulatory regions identified in STARR/MPRA/CRISPRi assays\nQuantitative analyze the regulatory effects measured in STARR/MPRA/CRISPRi assays\nStudy the physical interactions of regulatory regions using intact Hi-C assay"
